/**
   * The App component serves as the root component of the application.
   * It imports and renders the Chai component.
   * 
   * In React, components are used to build the UI. When you import a component
   * and use it within JSX, you use the component as a custom HTML tag. This is
   * because React components are designed to be reusable and composable.
   * 
   * ### Explanation
   * - **Importing the Component**: The Chai component is imported to be used within the App component.
   * - **Using the Component in JSX**: By using `<Chai />` in JSX, React is instructed to render the Chai 
   * component at that location in the UI.
   * 
   * ### Example
   * ```jsx
   * import Chai from './chai.jsx';
   * 
   * function App() {
   *   return (
   *     <Chai />
   *   );
   * }
   * 
   * export default App;
   * ```

import Chai from './chai.jsx'
function App() {

  return (
    <Chai />
  );
    }
export default App
