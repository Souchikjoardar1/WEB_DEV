        event listener on a button.

        referring to the React instance.
        When the button is clicked, "button clicked" and the React instance are logged to
        the console.

            Purpose of bind:
            The bind method is used to create a new function that, when called,
            has its this keyword set to the provided value.
            In this case, this.handleClick.bind(this) ensures that this inside handleClick refers
            to the instance of the React class.
            Without bind:
            If bind were not used, this inside handleClick would refer to the button element
            (the event target) instead of the React instance.
            This would result in undefined or unexpected behavior when accessing properties 
            like this.library or this.server.
