# Web Dev Repository

Welcome to the **Web Dev** repository! This is my personal space where I document and track my progress in web development, specifically focusing on JavaScript. As a beginner, I find it essential to monitor my daily learning and practice, and this repository serves as a diary of my journey.

## About Me

I'm an engineering graduate with a degree in Computer Science Engineering. Although I have a formal education in computer science, web development is a field that excites me, and JavaScript, in particular, is a language I'm passionate about mastering. This repository reflects my continuous efforts to learn and apply more advanced JavaScript concepts.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

- **Daily Practice Files**: Code snippets, small projects, and exercises that I work on every day to sharpen my JavaScript skills.
- **Learning Notes**: Notes and summaries on various JavaScript concepts and web development topics that I explore.
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects where I apply the concepts I've learned. These projects range from basic JavaScript applications to slightly more complex ones as I progress.
- **Advanced Concepts**: As I grow more comfortable with JavaScript, I plan to dive into more advanced topics. This section will include experiments with ES6+, asynchronous programming, APIs, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is primarily for my personal tracking, but anyone interested in following along or learning from my experience is welcome to explore the content:

1. **Browse the Folders**: Each folder is organized by date or topic. Feel free to explore the different folders to see what I've been working on.
2. **Check Out the Code**: The code is written with simplicity in mind, given my current beginner level. If you spot any improvements or wish to suggest better practices, I'm open to feedback!
3. **Follow My Progress**: I'll be updating this repository regularly as I continue learning. If you're also on a similar journey, maybe you'll find some of my projects and notes helpful.

## Future Goals

As I advance in my learning, I plan to:

- Build more complex web applications.
- Contribute to open-source JavaScript projects.
- Explore other areas of web development, including front-end frameworks like React, Vue.js, and backend technologies like Node.js.
