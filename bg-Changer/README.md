👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate web developer with hands-on experience in building engaging and interactive front-end applications. Here’s a quick overview of my work and skills.

💻 My Latest Project: Color Memory Game
Check out my latest project, Color Memory Game, an interactive game built using React.js.

🎮 About the Game
The Color Memory Game challenges players to remember and replicate a sequence of colors displayed by the app. Each round, the sequence becomes a bit more challenging, pushing your memory to the limits! This game is a fun exercise for players and demonstrates complex state management and dynamic rendering in React. Here are some highlights:

Dynamic Game Logic: The game generates random color sequences and evaluates the user's input, offering win/loss feedback.
Interactive UI: Using React hooks (useState, useEffect), the interface updates in real-time with background color changes, button state, and animations for a smooth user experience.
Custom Styles & Animation: Created dynamic animations for the game’s rules, sequence flash, and win/loss messages to make the game visually appealing.
Feature-rich Functionality: Players can start/restart the game, see rules on-demand, and receive prompts for each win/loss result.
🚀 Skills & Technologies
Languages & Frameworks: Proficient in JavaScript and React.js. Experienced in HTML5 and CSS3 for creating responsive, accessible web applications.
Design & UI: Skilled in creating clean, intuitive interfaces using CSS animations, and effects, and optimizing for UX.
Problem-Solving & Debugging: Strong debugging skills and a keen eye for details to ensure reliable and optimized code.
Version Control: Experienced with Git and GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management.
